  # Relative Strength Index (RSI)
  #
  # This method takes in an array of historical prices for a stock and a
  # period (the number of days to calculate the RSI over). It uses
  # the `each_cons` method to iterate over a sliding window of closing
  # prices and calculate the gains and losses for each window. Then, it
  # calculates the average gain and average loss for the time period and
  # uses these values to calculate the RSI. The method returns the RSI
  # value for the given period.
  #
  #   over_bought if rsi >= 70
  #   over_sold   if rsi <= 30
