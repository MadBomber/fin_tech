    # Calculates the momentum of a stock based on the rate of change (ROC).
    #
    # The interpretation of a stock's momentum value in terms of forecasting future 
    # price depends on the specific trading strategy or approach being used. However, 
    # in general, a positive momentum value indicates that the stock's price has been 
    # increasing over the specified period, while a negative momentum value indicates 
    # that the stock's price has been decreasing.
    # 
    # Here are some common interpretations of momentum values:
    # 
    # 1. Positive Momentum: A positive momentum value suggests that the stock's 
    # price has been trending upwards. This could indicate that the stock is in 
    # an uptrend and may continue to rise in the near future. Traders and investors 
    # may interpret this as a bullish signal and consider buying or holding the 
    # stock.
    #
    # 2. Negative Momentum: A negative momentum value suggests that the stock's 
    # price has been trending downwards. This could indicate that the stock is 
    # in a downtrend and may continue to decline in the near future. Traders and 
    # investors may interpret this as a bearish signal and consider selling or 
    # avoiding the stock.
    #
    # 3. High Momentum: A high positive momentum value indicates a strong upward 
    # trend in the stock's price. This could suggest that the stock has significant 
    # buying pressure and may continue to rise. Traders and investors may interpret 
    # this as a strong bullish signal and consider entering or adding to their 
    # positions.
    #
    # 4. Low Momentum: A low positive momentum value suggests a weak upward trend 
    # or a sideways movement in the stock's price. This could indicate a lack of 
    # significant buying pressure. Traders and investors may interpret this as a 
    # neutral signal and may choose to wait for a stronger momentum signal or look 
    # for other indicators to make trading decisions.
    # 
    # It's important to note that momentum alone may not be sufficient for 
    # accurate price forecasting. It is often used in conjunction with other 
    # technical indicators, fundamental analysis, or market conditions to make 
    # more informed trading decisions.
    #
    # Additionally, the interpretation of momentum values may vary depending on 
    # the time frame and the specific trading strategy being employed. Traders and 
    # investors should consider their own risk tolerance, investment goals, and 
    # trading approach when interpreting momentum values for forecasting future 
    # price movements.

    # @param prices [Array] An array of historical prices.
    # @param period [Integer] The number of periods to consider for calculating the ROC.
    # @return [Float] The momentum of the stock.
