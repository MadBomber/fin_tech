    # Determines if a stock exhibits mean reversion behavior based on a given 
    # price series.
    #
    # Mean Reversion Strategies: Mean reversion strategies aim to capitalize on 
    # the tendency of prices to revert to their mean or average value. These 
    # strategies involve identifying overextended price movements and taking 
    # positions that anticipate a return to the mean.
    #
    # @param prices [Array] An array of historical prices.
    # @param lookback_period [Integer] The number of periods to consider for calculating the mean.
    # @param deviation_threshold [Float]  The threshold for considering a 
    #                                     price movement as overextended.  For example
    #                                     0.50 is a 50 cent (half dollar) change.
    # @return [Boolean] True if the stock exhibits mean reversion behavior, 
    #                   false otherwise.
