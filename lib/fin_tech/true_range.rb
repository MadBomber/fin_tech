    # Calculates the True Range (TR) for a given set of price data.
    #
    # The True Range is a measure of the price volatility of a security over a given
    # period.  It is calculated as the greatest of the following three values:
    # - The difference between the current high and the current low.
    # - The absolute value of the difference between the current high and the previous 
    #   close.
    # - The absolute value of the difference between the current low and the previous 
    #   close.
    #
    # The True Range helps to capture the true extent of price movement, taking 
    # into account potential gaps or price jumps between periods. It is often used 
    # as a component in calculating other indicators, such as the Average True Range.
    #
    # @param high_prices [Array] An array of high prices.
    # @param low_prices [Array] An array of low prices.
    # @param previous_closes [Array] An array of previous closing prices.
    # @return [Array] An array of True Range values.

    # Calculates the Average True Range (ATR) for a given set of price data.
    #
    # The Average True Range is an indicator that calculates the average of the 
    # True Range values over a specified period. It provides a measure of the 
    # average volatility of a security over that period.
    #
    # The ATR is commonly used to assess the volatility of a security, identify 
    # potential trend reversals, and determine appropriate stop-loss levels. Higher 
    # ATR values indicate higher volatility, while lower ATR values indicate lower 
    # volatility.
    #
    # For example, a 14-day Average True Range would calculate the average of the 
    # True Range values over the past 14 trading days. Traders and analysts may
    # use this indicator to set stop-loss levels based on the average volatility 
    # of the security.
    #
    # @param high_prices [Array] An array of high prices.
    # @param low_prices [Array] An array of low prices.
    # @param close_prices [Array] An array of closing prices.
    # @param period [Integer] The period for calculating the ATR.
    # @return [Array] An array of Average True Range values.
