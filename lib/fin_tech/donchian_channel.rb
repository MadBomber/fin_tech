  # Calculates the Donchian Channel for a given period and input data.
  #
  # In the domain of computer programming, a Donchian Channel is a technical
  # analysis indicator used to identify potential breakouts and trend reversals
  # in financial markets. It consists of three lines: the upper channel line,
  # the lower channel line, and the middle line.
  #
  # The upper channel line is calculated by finding the highest high over
  # a specified period of time, while the lower channel line is calculated
  # by finding the lowest low over the same period. The middle line is simply
  # the average of the upper and lower channel lines.
  #
  # @param period [Integer] The period for the Donchian Channel.
  # @param input_data [Array] An array of values.
  # @return [Array] An array of arrays representing the Donchian Channel.
  #
