    # Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
    # 
    #
    # The MACD is a trend-following momentum indicator that measures the
    # relationship between two moving averages over a specified time period. The
    # MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term moving average from the
    # short-term moving average.
    #
    # The method takes in an array of historical prices for a stock, a short period
    # (the number of days to calculate the short-term moving average over), a long
    # period (the number of days to calculate the long-term moving average over),
    # and a signal period (the number of days to calculate the signal line moving
    # average over).
    #
    # The method first calculates the short-term moving average by calling the
    # `moving_averages` method with the `prices` array and the `short_period`
    # parameter. It then calculates the long-term moving average by calling the
    # `moving_averages` method with the `prices` array and the `long_period`
    # parameter.
    #
    # Next, the method calculates the MACD line by subtracting the long-term moving
    # average from the short-term moving average. This is done by taking the last
    # element of the `short_ma` array (which contains the short-term moving
    # averages for each window) and subtracting the last element of the `long_ma`
    # array (which contains the long-term moving averages for each window).
    #
    # Finally, the method calculates the signal line by taking the moving average of
    # the MACD line over the specified `signal_period`. This is done by calling the
    # `moving_averages` method with the `short_ma` array and the `signal_period`
    # parameter, and taking the last element of the resulting array.
    #
    # The method returns an array containing the MACD line and the signal line.
    #
    # Note that this is just a basic implementation of the MACD indicator, and there
    # are many variations and refinements that can be made depending on the
    # specific requirements of your program.
    #
    # The Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is a technical analysis
    # indicator that is used to identify changes in momentum, direction, and trend
    # for a security. The MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-period
    # exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA.
    #
    # The values 1.8231937142857078 and 164.44427957142855 that you provided are
    # likely the MACD line and the signal line, respectively. The MACD line is the
    # difference between the 12-period EMA and the 26-period EMA, while the signal
    # line is a 9-period EMA of the MACD line.
    #
    # The MACD line crossing above the signal line is often considered a bullish
    # signal, while the MACD line crossing below the signal line is often
    # considered a bearish signal. The distance between the MACD line and the
    # signal line can also provide insight into the strength of the trend.
    #
    # Without additional context, it's difficult to interpret the specific values of
    # 1.8231937142857078 and 164.44427957142855 for the MACD and signal lines of a
    # stock. However, in general, the MACD can be used to identify potential buy
    # and sell signals for a security, as well as to provide insight into the
    # strength of the trend.
