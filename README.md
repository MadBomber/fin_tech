# FinTech

A collection of financial technical analysis methods.

I'm not a quant but I saw one on TV and thought it was cool.

## Big Disclaimer - Must Read - Must Remember

Some of these methods may make buy/sell/hold recommendations.  Don't take them seriously.  This is for entertainment and educational purposes only.  If you loose your shirt in the market don't come crying to me because you used one of the methods in this collection.  You are warned.  Have fun.  Its a game.
